# Webpage Design Structure and Layout

## Overall Structure
The webpage will be organized as follows:

1. **Header Section**
   - Title: "Global Health Data Visualization Dashboard"
   - Subtitle: "Interactive visualizations of global health metrics and trends"
   - Navigation menu for quick access to different visualization sections

2. **Introduction Section**
   - Brief overview of the data sources and visualization objectives
   - Key insights summary from the data analysis
   - Instructions on how to interact with the visualizations

3. **Dashboard Overview**
   - Grid of thumbnail cards for each visualization
   - Quick navigation to specific visualizations
   - Categorization by data source (Global Health, Life Expectancy, Heart Disease)

4. **Visualization Sections**
   - Each visualization will have its own dedicated section
   - Sections will include:
     - Title and chart type
     - Interactive visualization (HTML version)
     - Description of the visualization
     - Key insights from the data
     - Data source information
     - Download button for the visualization (PNG format)

5. **Footer Section**
   - Credits and acknowledgments
   - Data sources references
   - Contact information

## Layout Design
- Responsive layout using CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Mobile-first approach with breakpoints for tablet and desktop
- Collapsible sections for better mobile experience
- Fixed navigation for easy access to different sections

## Visual Design Elements
- Clean, modern aesthetic with a focus on data visualization
- Color scheme:
  - Primary: #2c3e50 (dark blue)
  - Secondary: #3498db (light blue)
  - Accent: #e74c3c (red)
  - Background: #f5f5f5 (light gray)
  - Text: #333333 (dark gray)
- Typography:
  - Headings: 'Montserrat', sans-serif
  - Body text: 'Open Sans', sans-serif
  - Data labels: 'Roboto Mono', monospace
- Visual hierarchy to guide users through the content
- Consistent spacing and alignment

## Interactive Elements
- Toggle between interactive (HTML) and static (PNG) versions
- Filtering options for visualization categories
- Smooth scrolling navigation
- Responsive hover effects
- Modal dialogs for detailed information

## Technical Considerations
- Load visualizations dynamically to improve initial page load time
- Lazy loading for images and heavy content
- Accessibility considerations (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation)
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Performance optimization for mobile devices

## Section Organization
The visualizations will be organized into three main categories based on their data sources:

1. **Global Health Metrics**
   - Average Mortality Rate by Disease Category
   - Mortality Rate Over Years
   - Urbanization Rate vs Mortality Rate by Country
   - Education Index vs Prevalence Rate by Country
   - Heatmap of Mortality Rate by Country and Disease
   - Total Population Affected by Disease Category
   - Average Mortality Rate by Country (Choropleth)

2. **Life Expectancy Analysis**
   - Average Life Expectancy Over Time
   - Top 10 Countries by Average Life Expectancy
   - GDP vs Life Expectancy

3. **Heart Disease Insights**
   - Cholesterol Distribution by Gender
   - Age Distribution by Heart Disease Presence
   - Heart Disease Feature Comparison
